#Oldowan Tech Image Recognition

This project is an iterative development of a machine-learning application using YOLOv4 for detecting and auditing energy systems in the corporate and construction industries.

My responsibilities included creating a user interface based on the client's agreement with UX design, coordinate the clientâ€™s requests, working with the UX designer to redesign the frontend aesthetic, and using JSON to pull metadata from S3 bucket onto user interface to populate table for model training.
